          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            Working with React applications and Node.js at Kenna was a great experience. The team was very knowledgeable and
            supportive when it came to helping me navigate the various technologies. I was able to learn how to set up a React 
            application from scratch and how to use Node.js to build and deploy the application. I was also able to learn about
            the benefits of using React and Node.js in order to create an efficient and modern web application. The team was 
            also very helpful in providing me with tips and tricks to help me optimize the code and get the most out of the 
            application. Overall, working at Kenna has helped me gain valuable experience and knowledge 
            in web development and has given me a greater appreciation for the technologies used in modern web applications.
            <br>
            I was responsible for developing and maintaining React applications that worked with Node.js. This included
            creating components, integrating data from APIs, writing unit tests, and debugging issues. I worked closely with
            the software engineering team to ensure that the applications were functioning correctly and meeting the 
            needs of the business.
            <br>
            Throughout the process, I was able to gain valuable experience and knowledge about React and Node.js.
            I learned how to use React's component-based structure and the advantages of using Node.js for back-end development.
            I also gained a better understanding of how to structure code for applications and how to debug and fix errors.
            <br>
            IBM Notes (formerly Lotus Notes) is an enterprise-level software platform that provides email, calendar,
            contacts, and workflow capabilities. It is a powerful, feature-rich system that enables businesses to manage 
            their communications, collaboration, and data. IBM Notes is a secure and reliable platform that is used by 
            Kenna to manage their day-to-day operations.
            
            <br>
            IBM Notes also provides a variety of security features such as encryption, authentication, and access control.
            It also offers a range of customization options allowing users to tailor their experience to their own needs. 
            Additionally, IBM Notes can integrate with other IBM applications,
            such as IBM Watson and IBM Connections, allowing users to access their data and collaborate with others in one place.

          <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
          <p>In summary, this work term proved to be a fruitful summer as I was able to learn a lot from this
            experience, and improve on both my personal and technical skills. I have found a new interest in
            front-end development and would recommend anyone starting out in the co-op program to try
            their hand at it. I got the opportunity to learn from industry professionals, see how things are run
            within a small development team, and practice what I learned from university. I learned my
            strengths, and weaknesses, and have understood what areas I need to improve on in future co-op
            terms.
